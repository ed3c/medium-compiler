          'A coding agent can write a great deal of code and still fail to deliver a trustworthy product. The hard part is not producing more tokens. It is keeping a long chain of work pointed at the same goal while the environment, the codebase, and the evidence continue to change.',
          'A software factory treats delivery as a loop rather than a single coding session. A signal becomes a plan, the plan becomes isolated work, and the work must survive independent review before it can ship. The important shift is from asking whether the model produced plausible code to asking whether the system can prove what happened and whether the result satisfies the original intent.',

The contract is established before implementation, so a worker cannot quietly redefine success after seeing what it produced.',
          'Execution and judgment are separated. Workers implement features in isolated contexts. A scrutiny validator inspects source code, tests, type checks, lint results, and implementation history, but it does not repair the candidate it is judging. A user-testing validator takes the opposite view: it never reads the source and instead drives the running application through its external interface. The two perspectives target different failure modes, including code that looks plausible internally but exposes a dummy or broken user experience.',
          'Long-horizon autonomy makes the completion boundary harder, not easier. A loop can run for hours or days without establishing that it is still pursuing the right objective. For open-ended tasks, the unresolved problem is how to define done strongly enough to resist goal drift and reward hacking without pretending that every useful outcome can be reduced to one static test suite.'
